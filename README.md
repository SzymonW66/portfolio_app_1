Simple portfolio made with Python + Flask, HTML, CSS, and a little bit of JS
Then application was put to the Azure


What i do on pages: 
- O mnie- just normal inforamtion page
- Galeria nr 1- Gallery number 1 (when You aim with Your mouse on picture it gets bigger
- Index1- page which all rest pages interherit from
- Kontakt- contact form from Bootstrap

- Księga gości- guestbook with database behind (lightSQL)
- Stwórz wpis- adding new guests and theirs messages
- Księga gości- admin- admin can delete or edit guests messages
- Login- OAuth2 via GITHUB (now it dosen't work idk why)

What I could do better:
- deffinitely design (i focused on backend, frontend was only to be there and see how it connects from behind)
- more english names, not polish ones
- one new funcionality = one new commit
- commits decriptions in English
